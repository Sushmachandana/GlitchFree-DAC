2-Bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with Glitch Reduction
This project implements a 2-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) circuit designed in KiCad, featuring a basic resistor ladder network and an operational amplifier (UA741) for glitch reduction and analog signal smoothing. The circuit converts 2-bit digital input to an analog output.
