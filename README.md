# 2-Bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) with Glitch Reduction

This project implements a 2-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) circuit designed in **KiCad**, featuring a basic resistor ladder network and an operational amplifier (**UA741**) for glitch reduction and analog signal smoothing. The circuit converts 2-bit digital input to an analog output.

## Project Description

This DAC circuit takes a 2-bit digital input and produces a corresponding analog voltage. The design includes **binary-weighted resistors** and an **operational amplifier** to stabilize the output signal, minimizing glitches.

## Components Used

- **UA741**: Operational Amplifier for signal stabilization
- **Resistors**: Binary-weighted resistors (1K, 2K, etc.)
- **Voltage Sources**: DC voltage sources for digital input simulation

## Circuit Design

The circuit uses binary-weighted resistors to create DAC functionality, with each resistor corresponding to a bit in the digital input (D0 to D3). An operational amplifier is used to stabilize the output signal and reduce glitches.

### Pin Configuration
- **Digital Inputs** (D0, D1, D2, D3): Binary inputs to control the DAC output
- **Output (OUT)**: Analog output voltage
- **Power (VDD/GND)**: Power supply for the operational amplifier

## Constraints

- **Power Supply**: The operational amplifier requires a stable power supply (usually +5V or +12V).
- **Resistor Values**: Accurate resistor values (1K, 2K, etc.) are necessary for correct DAC operation.
- **Input Voltage Levels**: Ensure input voltages match the logic levels of the system to avoid errors.
- **Op-Amp Choice**: Using the UA741 for the op-amp may limit the performance; consider upgrading to a low-offset, high-speed op-amp for better glitch reduction.
- **Filtering**: Additional capacitive filtering may be required for smoother output.
